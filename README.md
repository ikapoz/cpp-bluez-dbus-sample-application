# cpp-bluez-dbus-sample-application
This project is a minimal-dependency C++ application that demonstrates how to  create a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) server with advertising using the BlueZ stack  via the D-Bus interface.  It is designed to run on Linux systems and relies solely on the native D-Bus  libraryâ€”no external Bluetooth libraries required.
